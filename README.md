#### **THIS REPOSITORY WILL CONTAIN AN ANDROID TO DO LIST APP**

<hr>

## topics we're going to talk about in this readme file:

<hr>

* List of technologies I  used to develop this app.
* Link to my wireframe in this case I used Figma.
* My user stories.
* Story about my development process and problem-solving strategy.
* List of unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
* Describtion of how some of my favorite functions work.




### TECHNOLOGIES:

<hr>

* I used figma to help me do a scetch of how I want my app to look like.
* I used android studio and took my figma scetch and transformed it into a deisgn using the android studio xml layout.
* I started working on my app and I started writing the logic of the app using kotlin langauge. 
* I used Room for my database

### USER STORIES:

1. As a user, I want an app that can help me to document my tasks "todos" so that I can always go back to it and see the tasks I'm supposed to do.
2. As a user, I want a feature in the app that allows me to add, update, delete tasks so that I can always be up-to-date.
3. As a user, I want to be able to search for a specific task so that I can find the task that I'm looking for easily.
4. As a user, I want to be able to sort and filter the tasks by different catagories like filtering the completed tasks and sorting the tasks alphabetically.

<hr>


### My Development Process:
 
 * Planning: First, I started to plan how I want my application to look like, and how it's going to function, what features I want to include in it.
 * Requirement specification: Second, I went ahead and documented the requirements and specifications that were asked from me to develop the app.
 * Design: Third, I begin to design the app using figma, I picked the primary and secondary colors for my app, started to design my buttons and layout.
 * Coding: Forth, I started to work on my code and the logic behind it and wrote the functions I needed for my app to work.
 * Testing: Fifth, Finally, I started  testing my app using the debugging tools in the android studio.

<hr>


### Unsolved problems and diffeclties:

* I tried to sort my views based on the due date but I was unable to compete it because I used declared the due date as a string.

* I tried using the FlowData for my getSearchItems function but I was unable to successeed because I found it hard to understand.

<hr>



### Favorite Functions:

The getSearchItems  "for the search bar" is my favorite function because it was new to me and I worked hard to make it work, I searched a lot, asked around and finally I was able to write the proper function.
