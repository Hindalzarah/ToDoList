### TECHNOLOGIES:

First thing, I used figma to help me do a scetch of how I want my app to look like.
then I used android studio and took my figma scetch and transformed it into a deisgn using the android studio xml layout.
lastly, I started working on my app and I started writing the logic of the app using kotlin langauge.
