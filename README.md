#### **THIS REPOSITORY WILL CONTAIN AN ANDROID TO DO LIST APP**

## topics we're going to talk about in this readme file:

* List of technologies I  used to develop this app.
* Link to my wireframe in this case I used Figma.
* My user stories.
* Story about my development process and problem-solving strategy.
* List of unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
* Describtion of how some of my favorite functions work.




### TECHNOLOGIES:

First thing, I used figma to help me do a scetch of how I want my app to look like.
then I used android studio and took my figma scetch and transformed it into a deisgn using the android studio xml layout.
lastly, I started working on my app and I started writing the logic of the app using kotlin langauge.

### USER STORIES:

1. As a user, I want an app that can help me to document my tasks "todos" so that I can always go back to it and see the tasks I'm supposed to do.
2. As a user, I want a feature in the app that allows me to add, update, delete tasks so that I can always be up-to-date.
3. As a user, I want to be able to search for a specific task so that I can find the task that I'm looking for easily.
4. As a user, I want to be able to sort and filter the tasks by different catagories like filtering the completed tasks and sorting the tasks alphabetically.
